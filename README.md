# Venturing Function Dynamics

Interactive simulation of a nested functional architecture for venture creation and evolution.

## The Three Levels

- **Level 1 -- Framing:** Converts fuzzy (probabilistic) representations of a present situation and an imaginary situation into a crisp binary venture idea using a configurable threshold.
- **Level 2 -- Modelling:** Applies an ordering scheme (template) to the raw idea, producing a rigid venture concept with positional constraints.
- **Level 3 -- Venturing:** Places the concept into a dynamic binary environment where an agent senses, moves, and flips bits to maximise fit -- yielding success, failure, or abandonment.

## How to use

1. Adjust sliders to change thresholds, concept size, agent capabilities, and environment parameters.
2. Click **Generate New Idea** and **Apply Scheme to Idea** to prepare a venture concept.
3. Hit **Start Venture** to watch the agent attempt to fit the concept into the environment in real time.
4. Use **Single Step** to advance one timestep at a time.
